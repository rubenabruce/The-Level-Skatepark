# The-Level-Skatepark
A website dedicated to The Level Skatepark.

Features:
Restful API calls to Met office weather.
CSS animations.
Server routing though express.js.
Fetching data from SQLite database.
DOM manipulation useing vanilla JS and Jquery.


Although this website is filled with bad practise I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Express and SQLite.
